			li Because it would be obnoxious to have to write this by hand every week and a half or so
			li.topic xxxxday, Month xx
			li But I do think it should list a week and a half ahead of the current department
			li.topic xxxxday, Month xx
			li And then repopulate every week so there's a half week of overlap always
			li.topic xxxxday, Month xx
			li I hope that it will be at least this long
			li Otherwise it looks a little funny
			li Nothing breaks no matter how long/short it looks but it just looks funny
			li Basically, it needs to be just longer than the mission statement to not look funny
