				h4 DAS PDP Participation Guidelines:

							li Attend to registration timelines and register in a timely manner
							li Communicate with their coordinators to ensure their availability for the duration of the event
							li Be sure you are clear on the learning objectives outlined for any event you register for
							li Complete any preparatory work assigned by the facilitators
